B015Z7XE0A,2,It's doing the job as of now but it's poorly made.,"I bought this converter because it had good reviews and looked sleek. The day I received it arrived it felt like something was loose but I didnâ€™t pay any mind to it. After a few days of using it, the shell came off.  It still functions but doesn't look sleek.

B015Z7XE0A,1,Stopped working after about 1 month!,"At first, this was an amazing product. Had zero trouble connecting straight from the package. I was up and running within literally seconds on my new MacBook Pro with the control bar. Sadly, after only about a month of use it began to get really hot while plugged in and then just flat out stopped working.",n/a,-1,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1
B015Z7XE0A,1,uses too much power almost broke my macbook,"I needed an adapter while traveling to reset my phone.

B015Z7XE0A,3,Doesnâ€™t fit USB Wireless Receiver,"My laptop has only USB-C ports. Therefore, I canâ€™t plugin a USB wireless receiver. So I purchased this small adapter. It works fine however it didnâ€™t fit the whole USB receiver in it. The USB receiver fits only half way. It should be the same for other devices as well.

B015Z7XE0A,4,"Nice look and feel, Flawed Design","The aesthetic of this product looks great, however the design is a major flaw especially on the 2017 Macbook Pro. I have the Nonda USB-C to HDMI adapter as well and cannot plug both plugs in as this USB-C to USB 3.0 adapter is too bulky. Would not recommend.Edit: Although the product wasn't used as intended.

B07J65G9DD,4,Good for price,"Works as advertised. Pretty much just plug and play. It also comes with a mini cd to install drivers but I found it to be okay without installing them. Speed is pretty good for $20, very stable connection.",1,1,n/a,n/a,1,n/a,1
B07J65G9DD,5,Awesome Speed,"I purchased the TechKey WiFi adapter for an older laptop that did not have a 5 GHz WiFi card needed to take advantage of a newly installed 80 Mbps DSL line.Much to my delight, installation of the TechKey WiFi adapter was easy plug 'n play for Windows 10.  But the best surprise was the awesome outcome of the speed test.  With a newer laptop, connected directly to the modem with an Ethernet line, I was getting ONLY 55 Mbps download connected to the 80 Mbps DSL.  After installation of the TechKey WiFi adapter on the older laptop, the speed test reported a ripping 75 Mbps!I couldn't resist plugging in the TechKey WiFi adapter to the newer laptop and PRESTO, I got 75 Mbps on the speed test.  Faster download speed than a direct connection to the Ethernet line!  I will be ordering another one of these!!!In my scoring of the TechKey WiFi adapter, I gave 5 stars for Tech Support even though I have had no occasion to contact Tech Support.",n/a,1,n/a,1,n/a,1,n/a
B07J65G9DD,3,broke after a few months,"Was pretty darn fast for the most part. I can see wifi networks, I can attempt to connect. Fails. Tried a system restore to see if it was my computer, no change.",n/a,-1,n/a,n/a,1,n/a,n/a
B07J65G9DD,1,Well that was a joke,Product comes with extremely poor documentation. Apparently the website for drivers doesn't exist and it says it comes with drivers on cd (spoiler: it doesn't).It refuses to connect to the 5ghz radio on my router. I can get it to connect to the 2.4ghz but even though it is only a few feet away it constantly drops connection.When connection is active I get about 10Mbps of throughput on a 35Mbps connection.I can only conclude all the positive reviews on this site are astroturf because this product is a joke. Do not buy it.,n/a,-1,n/a,-1,-1,n/a,-1
B07J65G9DD,1,Worked good for 2 months ...,"Install was easy. It automatically connected to our home Wi-Fi for the first month. Then it started to intermittently connect and I had to toggle back and forth with the internet connection settings.Now, 2 months after I bought it, it the connection is very inconsistent and there are times it will not connect at all.Of course, I am outside the return window and am screwed.I chose this device because it specifically said it wouldn't have this problem like all the others do!!!",n/a,-1,n/a,n/a,-1,n/a,1
B07J65G9DD,4,Easy Install Rating 4 Because Dropped 5G; No Website Tech Support (Website),I rated a 4 because install was super easy and I love the swivel action! Tech support is not available online or in the manual. No FAQs or forum online. My 5Ghz  dropped 3 times and didn't automatically reconnect in the span of about 2 hours. That led me to look for tech support. The manual included in the downloadable driver files is also printed and included in the package. Neither have troubleshooting information.,n/a,n/a,n/a,-1,1,n/a,1
B07J65G9DD,5,It was a good experience to buy this device,"Firstly I can say it is an Amazon choice device which is important for me when I am shopping in Amazon.Secondly it has an incredible discount now then don't hesitate and buy it with several simple clicks.Moreover, its installation was really easy and it has a good user manual provided. Also, it has tutorial for both mac and windows.In addition, there is no need to mention that lots of customers bought this device and it is one of popular wifi adapters in amazon.",1,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1
B07J65G9DD,1,Worked only a month!,"Bought this Wifi adapter since I started working from home permanently and the office computer don't have wifi connection. Bought it and worked fine for a month, after that the wifi shows connected but no internet working. This is the adapter as I connected to two different computers and did the same thing and sure is not the wifi signal because everything else stays connected. DO NOT RECOMMEND! Sucks and the worst part is that is too late for me to return it now.",n/a,-1,n/a,n/a,-1,n/a,n/a
B07J65G9DD,1,WINDOWS 7 PRO WARNING! DO  NOT  BUY!,"POS would not work despite using drivers from multiple sources (included CD and internet). Would not let my computer completely reboot after restart. Screen stayed black until the POS was removed from my USB port. Drivers are garbage, it starts out DISABLED and would not load any of the 10 wifi signals that my phone can pick up from my home as well as those around me. It just sat there blinking whenever you tried to select it (left side of the window) to select the wifi signal you wanted to use.

B07J65G9DD,3,Not bad overall. Great solution for a laptop with a broken wifi card,"This product was okay. It worked fine until I broke it. The speed was decent but it wasn't always consistent.

B07J65G9DD,4,Solid simple WiFi adapter for USB,"The fit and finish were a little sloppy, but overall the product is solid and simple.

B07J65G9DD,1,Didn't work on 5G.,"Didn't work too good with Win 10 on the 5G channel.  But from what I've been reading, this is not unusual.  I tried it anyway because sometimes it does work.",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-1,n/a,n/a

I followed the instructions (even though they were not clear at times).  I installed the USB, loaded the drivers, restarted the computer and got ""unrecognized device"".  I removed the USB, restarted, then plugged in the USB.  Still got unrecognized device error.  I tried all USB ports, including those being used with no luck.  I opened device manager to check on the unrecognized device and was told by windows that the driver was up to date.If there was a support line (phone, email, FAQ, whatever) I would have contacted them, but I found nothing in the documents provided.I can't comment on the performance because I never got it to work.  I'm going to return it.",n/a,n/a,n/a,-1,-1,n/a,-1

B07N1WW638,5,Great alternative to the cable company's costly options,"Quick and simple install, reliable signal, and a great price when compared to the ten bucks a month that the cable company wanted to charge for Wifi extenders.My router sits down a hall at the far end of a room over the garage, on the second floor.  By placing this extender in a hall outlet nearest to the top of the stairs, it provided full bars to the entire first floor (previously receiving between 0 and 1 bars from the router).",1,n/a,n/a,n/a,1,n/a,1
B07N1WW638,5,Exactly what we needed.,Just set it up and it was extremely easy to do. I bought this because my 5ghz WiFi doesnâ€™t reach in to my backyard for my phone. Iâ€™m a smoker so my wife and I sit outside in the evening and I also grill quite a bit. This thing works like a charm so far. The fastest phone in the world is finally fast again! Very satisfied so far.,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1,n/a,1
B07N1WW638,1,Just buy a Netgear device.,"Total rubish. Would not connect using any of the instructions. I finally installed the app, and aside from seeing how onerous their privacy policy is (at least one other reviewer brought this up as well), noting would proceed past the connecting part of setup. Way more effort than similar devices have needed in the past. I believe the device is defective, but I saw yet another review stating that they could not get this device to connect to Spectrum internet either.",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-1,n/a,-1
B07N1WW638,3,Not sure about this,This is easy to install but the thing i hated was it does not automatically link with the existing WiFi name so you have to give it a new name and have to go into your setting each time to switch to the extender if you are in a part of the house with less connectivity.,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-1,n/a,1
B07N1WW638,5,Very easy to install (use the Tether app!!) and effectively extends our wireless network,"I set mine up about an hour ago and so far it works perfectly! It does a great job of extending our WiFi to cover our patio (which is on the opposite side of our house as our router).  There's a HUGE improvement from before I set up this device.  The setup was very easy too.  I used the Tether app as recommended in the instructions.  The hardest part was having to move the device around a few times to find a spot in the house where the signal was strong enough to use and still provided the best coverage for the areas that I wanted, but that was still really easy.  I'm very happy with the product and am kicking myself for not buying one of these sooner!",n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1,n/a,1
B07N1WW638,1,"Not reliable, Poor tech/warranty support,","We live in a track size two story house that is not large.  The dual band router provides good wifi but the signal is a little weak (not a dead zone) in one corner of the second floor.  After reading the reviews I bought this unit to improve the signal in that corner, I liked the WPS method of installation and the promised  24/7 phone support.  I installed it quickly and it worked for 6 weeks. Then one day the iPad and phone said ""no internet"" when attempting to sign into the -EXT wifi networks for both bands. The iPad and phone could sign into the slightly weaker wifi signal from my router in that corner of the second floor. I called the phone support but it is not available (COVID 19? but I thought Asia had recovered).  So I went on Chat, spent 1 hour and 20 minutes, response was  slow, several restarts, location changes but the problem remained.  Then I tried email.  They said I should use the Tether App method of installation etc.  Again several resets and Setups. Sending photos showing the unlit 5G led light, 3 -4 email exchanges.  My perception is that tech support people are overworked, undertrained and basically cut and paste scripts to respond to you.  They don't have time to read your emails completely.  Finally I asked to replace the failed unit under the 24 month warranty.  There was no response to that.  I bought the unit in May and it failed in June.  I finally gave up and returned the unit with 20% restocking charge.  So my conclusion: Unit is OK if it works but warranty/Tech support is poor.",n/a,-1,n/a,-1,-1,n/a,n/a
B07N1WW638,1,Send different product,"I ordered this and it clearly states dual band, both 2.4GHa and 5GHz.  Did not work with 5G.  Contacted tech support and they said the product I got did not work with 5GHz.  It had a different product number than what ordered.  Do not order this.  No telling what you will get.",n/a,-1,n/a,-1,-1,n/a,n/a
B07N1WW638,2,Not easy to set up.,"Sorry, but these gadgets are not easy to set up and use. Buyers should be cautioned such items are for ""Techies"" if they even can use them. Have not set mine up. Don't understand the - -lack of instructions.",n/a,n/a,n/a,-1,n/a,n/a,-1
B07N1WW638,2,worked well for a week ... and then 5G disappeared,"I bought two of these for my house.  I am an inveterate listener to podcasts and to courses like the Great Courses. I first upgraded to 5G with verizon. No problem. Then i need a wifi booster. I got two of these. They worked well week 1. Then they started to drop. Now, i'll be damned if i can get them to work. And if you can understand the instructions, i hand it to you.",n/a,-1,n/a,n/a,-1,-1,-1
B07N1WW638,5,Happy Camper,"Set up was very easy via the app. I watched the video on this page before settling up the extender. It works very well, the signal strength is very good. I needed this for a room farthest from the router, the wifi signal always drops so my cellphone would sometimes have to use cellular data. I do not have an unlimited data plan on my cellphone.  This product works as advertised, looks sleek & not bulky. Iâ€™m very happy with this purchase.",n/a,n/a,1,n/a,1,1,1

The picture doesn't do it justice, but you can see the bend. A silly oversight. It's not the end of the world, but I am bothered by it.

B07TDZVYNH,2,Regret buying.,Bought this for my son who is a rear facing car seat and to also use when in the stroller on warmer days. I was disappointed in how fast the battery dies. As a busy mother the last thing youâ€™re going to remember and have time to do is remember to go changer the battery every day. Also some of the foam has already come off. And now when I try to charge it  the hanging hole on the fan is placed crookedly so itâ€™s very hard to get the charger in and then you have to make sure youâ€™re holding it in the right place for it to stay charging. Honestly it was a waste of money. Not using it now.,n/a,-1,n/a,n/a,-1,n/a,n/a

B0819HZQWR,1,Learn from my mistake.,"Products are slim where i am at. So this was an urgent purchase. Amazon as always gets you what you need. But for the product it leaves you wanted something else. To make sure it worked i plug it into my charging brick with excitement. But that excitement quickly left me. My phone wasn't being charged. And the chord didn't lock into my phone. I asked a friend to test the chord. It charged their phone but didn't lock in. I then barrowed his chord it charged my phone but the plug was crooked in the phone. Come to find out the locking peice inside the charger broke off into my phone and now won't let any chord lock into my phone. Needless to say, this has been an expensive mistake and highly recommend not buying this product.
