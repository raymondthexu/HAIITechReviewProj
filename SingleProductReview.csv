1,The Apple AirPods are amazing and worth the price. The sound is crystal clear and the battery life is beyond believable. I have only charged them once since they arrived and I use them all the time.
2,"I’m so happy to go hands free whether it’s a phone call or audiobook and the sound quality is so much sharper with the Apple ear pods particularly with light background sounds/ ambient noises. . My ear canals are a little narrow, yet they stay put and are so comfortable that I forget they’re there. Great product."
3,I bought them here since they were cheaper than at the Apple Store and it was a good decision. They have a battery life that will last for several days and they have good sound quality. The only con would be the noise cancellation since they don't really have it.
4,"Best value choice for me, especially when on sale for under $90. I like the full but natural sound, not too much bass or treble. Minimal latency from wireless connection. Does a good job with automatic switching between Apple devices. I even like the original longer stems because easier to handle. I also prefer earbuds that do NOT block out and “cancel” external noise, for safety reasons, and no irritating rubber tips. I’m sure Pro version sounds a bit better and have a few extra features, but these old-school AirPods are much less expensive and work great for my needs."
5,"I’ve used newer generation AirPods, and these are good for if I’m on a budget.Because of the cost I was able to gift these to my girlfriend who never had AirPods at absolutely loves these.There are plenty of things that you can do while wearing the AirPods including answer the call, hang up and even mute, so it’s great that these have a lot of different features. Other simply don’tI do like how they fit in your ear and personally I’ve had these before as well and they do stay put pretty wellI will say that when my girlfriend is wearing the AirPods and we’re speaking on the phone that her voice and the sound is lower than if she was on speaker even though my volume is up all the way she sometimes still comes in at a lower volume.I will say that it’s super convenient to have a chargeable case where you can charge the AirPods without having to plug anything in and then charge the case either with or without the AirPods as needed.These are good quality and I know because I’ve owned them and use them that they lasted for me at least  Few years"
6,"I ordered these 2nd Generation Apple Airpods over 6 months ago. To this day, they are in perfect working condition, nearly the same way I received them. Upon trying out the sound quality of them, using a single one sounds wonky for being a product of Apple. Using both of them makes the quality sound a bit better, but still is questionable. It also would have been a much better product if there was full noise cancellation.The Bluetooth functionalities are a bit tricky to me especially since if you are connected to your phone, connecting to another device such as your laptop, is time consuming and complex. Some cool features of these Apple Airpods are it's voice controlling functionality, can use through phone calls, double tap to skip, and if you have an Apple Watch, it works as a tiny remote for the volume. You also do not have much of a say when they come with a lightning speed charger. It's a double win if the device charges quickly and the device has a life of 5 hours without the need of a charger. For the value of this product, the effectiveness is fair."
7,"NAME BRAND PRODUCT.  THE FIRST TIME PURCHASED AS I HAVE ANOTHER BRAND OF PHONE.  THEY CONNECTED IMMEDIATELY TO MY PHONE AND THEY ARE GREAT.  THE ONLY CHALLENGE IS THAT THE BATTERY LIFE (HOW LONG THEY LAST) SEEMS A BIT SHORTER THAN EXPECTED.  STILL, THEY ARE GREAT.  WOULD PURCHASE THEM AGAIN."
8,"I received this product and was originally extremely happy with this.  I loved that it was connected to my phone and would read text messages to me while in use.  However, after just a few months the in ear speakers stopped producing sound as loud as it originally did.  I have not even had these headphones for a full year and the in ear speakers have both completely stopped working and it is difficult to hear out of the speaker that is further back on the headphone... which means I need my volume turned up a little louder to be able to hear... which also means my phone is constantly telling me my listening volume is too loud although I can barely hear.  Prior to buying these headphones I typically would spend $20-30 on headphones at Walmart, Target, or similar stores because of the same reasons [the speakers in ear over time stop working].  I will go back to buying cheaper headphones as they last about the same time as the apple headphones but for a much lower price.  Very unhappy at the amount of money I paid and quality of the headphones did not even last half a year."
9,"Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised."
10,"Bought my first pair Oct 2022. it is april 2024 (17 months of use)  I honestly love them. They're great. Good battery life for a busy mom. make it through plane rides, a day of work etc. I bought a pink case so they're easy to find and more durable. Yesterday, suddenly, they stopped pairing. they charge fine, but are completely undiscoverable by any device, apple, non-apple, phone, pc, etc. after doing my own troubleshooting i reached out to support and did their trouble shooting who then sent me to a repair location. without Applecare, this would cost $19 for them to diagnose the issue then depending on what was broken, possibly $80+ to replace the part(s). I was told if it was one earbud that would be 80ish EACH and another 80 if the issue was the charging case. I bought these for $89... so it's just not economical.I will be repurchasing them. The tech at the repair store said an 18-24 month lifecycle is typically the max he sees for this product. I was considering applecare+ which is $30 for 2 years... however, the cost to replace a lost AirPod or the Charging Case is typically around $89 each without AppleCare+. With AppleCare+, accidental damage repairs, including replacements, are priced at $29 per incident. This fee applies to either the AirPods or the case. so 30+29=$59 and that's only if one piece is broken... not both or all three. i will not be purchasing Applecare for these airpods. I will keep the broken ones however, since the case charges fine, it will be nice to have that extra one just in case."
